This Repo holds all of the projects from CS 205 Concepts of Programming Algorithms in Java. 
I took this course from Johnson County Community College in the spring of 2012.
I really need to add some text files to explain what the goal of each assignment was but I'll probably never do that.
All of the problems with the exception of the three projects and the final come from
Java Software Solutions: 7th Edition by John Lewis and William Loftus.

feel free to contact me with any questions.
